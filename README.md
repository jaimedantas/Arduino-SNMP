# Arduino SNMP
The SNMP Device is an embedded hardware architecture capable of monitoring and controlling a data center environment. The design is based on an ATmega328p AVR microcontroller that behaves as a SNMP agent. The developed hardware architecture is able to monitor the temperature of several scattered sensors in the data center, and to control the opening of the communication rack door through a magnetic lock. Also, the embedded system is designed to perform the remote actuation of air conditioners located in the data center.
